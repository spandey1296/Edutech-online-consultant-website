The <b>National Service Scheme (NSS)</b> is an Indian government-sponsored public service program conducted by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of India. Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year in <b>1969</b>. Aimed at developing student's personality through community service, NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community (esp. Villages) linkage.

In May 1969, a conf student representatives (of universities and institutions of higher education) convened by the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission also unanimously agreed that a national-service scheme could be an instrument for national integration. The details were soon worked out and orientation camp was organized at <b>Rajghat</b>. This camp was concluded on 7th June 1969. <b>KKGupta</b> from DU was declared first volunteer.The Planning Commission sanctioned an outlay of â‚¹5 crores for the NSS during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, stipulating that the NSS be a pilot project in selected institutions and universities. On <b>24 September 1969</b>, the then Union Education Minister V.K.R.V. Rao launched the NSS at 37 universities in all states. The scheme has been extended to all states and universities in the country, and also +2 level institutes in many states.

The symbol for the NSS has been based on the giant <b>Rath Wheel</b> of the world-famous <b>Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda)</b> situated in Odisha, India. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release. It signifies the movement in life across time and space, the symbol thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change. <br>The <b>eight bars</b> in the wheel represents 24 hours of a day. <br>The <b>red colour</b> indicates that the volunteer is full of young blood that is lively, active, energetic and full of high spirit. The navy blue colour indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of the mankind. It stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social transformation and uplift.
